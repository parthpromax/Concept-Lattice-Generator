	It takes access matrix from "in.txt" as input. It will generate a dot file as output.

- CreateLattice.dot
	This file will be generated by CreateLattice.py. It contains code to generate lattice.

- Lattice.png
	This is the diagram generated from the CreateLattice.dot.

- Lattice.pdf
	It is portable version of the generated diagram.

- makefile
	It will be called by index.php. It contains command to run CreateLattice.py and generate CreateLattice.dot. Then it will generate Lattice.png & Lattice.pdf from CreateLattice.dot.
